# Future Broadband Usage Meter

This python script allows you to check your Future Broadband usage. It currently only gives the results for the first account, if you have multiple accounts.

It does not store your password, however it does store a cookie in the `cookies.pickle` file, so you don't need to enter your login details every time. The cookie will eventually expire, so be prepared to enter your details after a while.

This script isn't well tested - additionally, if the Future Broadband website changes, it may break the script. So please don't rely on it too much to check your usage.
